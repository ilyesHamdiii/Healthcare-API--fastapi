# Healthcare API (FastAPI)

## Description

A modern FastAPI backend for healthcare management, supporting users, appointments, articles, and notifications.  
Features JWT authentication, Docker containerization, and Nginx reverse proxy for efficient request handling and enhanced security.  
The application follows best practices for scalable API development and is designed to be easily extendable and maintainable.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework:** FastAPI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via SQLAlchemy ORM)
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Password Hashing:** passlib (bcrypt)
- **Environment Management:** python-dotenv
- **Testing:** pytest (recommended)
- **API Documentation:** OpenAPI/Swagger (auto-generated by FastAPI)
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Reverse Proxy:** Nginx

## Motivation

Healthcare systems need secure, scalable, and maintainable APIs for managing users, appointments, articles, and notifications.  
This project demonstrates how to build a modern healthcare backend using FastAPI, focusing on clean architecture, role-based access control, and extensibility.

## Why Build This Project?

- **Real-World Impact:** Healthcare platforms require robust, secure, and flexible APIs to support patient-doctor interactions, appointment scheduling, and information sharing.
- **Learning Modern Backend:** FastAPI is a cutting-edge Python framework that enables rapid development, automatic documentation, and strong security practices.
- **Unified User Management:** By treating doctors, patients, and admins as users with roles, the system is easier to maintain and extend.
- **Showcase Best Practices:** Demonstrates authentication, authorization, and clean separation of concerns for scalable API development.

## How to Experience the API

- ⚠️ **Note:** The `create user` role is left open **only for demonstration purposes**. In a production environment, this endpoint should be restricted to admins.
